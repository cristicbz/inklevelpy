inklevelpy
==========

Converts Inkscape SVG to a Lua level file usable with MOAI.

Inspired by halfnelson's similar project (InkscapeToLevel) but written from scratch in Python. Supports a couple more features as well, including images (with arbitrary transformations) and concave polygon triangulation.
